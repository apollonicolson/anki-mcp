"""MCP server running in background thread with HTTP transport.

This module implements the MCP server component that runs in a separate background
thread with its own asyncio event loop. It uses the official MCP SDK (FastMCP) to
handle the protocol and exposes Anki operations as MCP tools.

Architecture:
    - Background thread: Runs asyncio event loop with MCP server
    - HTTP transport: Uses FastMCP's built-in streamable HTTP (starlette + uvicorn)
    - Queue bridge: Tool handlers bridge calls to main thread via QueueBridge
    - Async I/O: All tool handlers use asyncio.to_thread to bridge blocking queue ops

Thread Safety:
    - This module runs entirely in a background thread
    - Never accesses mw.col directly - all Anki operations go through QueueBridge
    - Uses asyncio.to_thread to safely call blocking queue.Queue operations

    """MCP server running in background thread.

    This class manages the lifecycle of the MCP server which runs in a separate
    background thread with its own asyncio event loop. It uses FastMCP's built-in
    HTTP transport (starlette + uvicorn) for communication.

    The server acts as a bridge between AI clients and Anki's main thread:
    1. AI client sends MCP request via HTTP
    2. Tool handler receives request in background thread
    3. Handler puts request in queue and waits for response
    4. Main thread processes request and returns result via queue
    5. Handler returns result to AI client
