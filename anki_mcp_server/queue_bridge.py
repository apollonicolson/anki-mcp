"""Thread-safe communication bridge between MCP server and Anki main thread.

This module provides the core threading infrastructure for the AnkiMCP Server addon.
It enables safe communication between the background asyncio thread (running the
MCP server) and the Qt main thread (where Anki collection access is safe).

Architecture:
    - Background thread: MCP server handles protocol, puts requests in queue,
      blocks waiting for responses
    - Main thread: QTimer polls request queue, executes Anki operations, sends
      responses back

Thread Safety:
    - Uses Python's built-in `queue.Queue` which is thread-safe by design
    - Background thread is allowed to block on response_queue.get()
    - Main thread never blocks - uses get_nowait() in QTimer callback

    Created by the background thread (MCP server) when a tool call is received

    Attributes:
        request_id: Unique identifier to match requests with responses. Typically
            a UUID string.
        tool_name: Name of the tool to execute (e.g., "list_decks", "create_note").
            Must match a registered handler in the handler registry.
        arguments: Tool-specific arguments as a dictionary. These will be passed

    """Thread-safe bridge between MCP server and Anki main thread.

    This class provides the core infrastructure for safe cross-thread communication
    in the AnkiMCP addon. It uses Python's built-in Queue which is thread-safe and
    designed for producer-consumer patterns.

    Usage Pattern:
        1. Background thread (MCP server):
           - Creates ToolRequest
           - Calls send_request() - this BLOCKS until response is ready
           - Returns result to MCP client

        2. Main thread (QTimer callback every 25ms):
           - Calls get_pending_request() - non-blocking
           - If request found, executes on Anki collection
           - Calls send_response() - unblocks waiting background thread

    Thread Safety:
        - request_queue: Background thread writes (put), main thread reads (get_nowait)
        - response_queue: Main thread writes (put), background thread reads (get with timeout)
        - Both queues are thread-safe by design (queue.Queue uses locks internally)

    Shutdown Handling:
        - Setting _shutdown=True prevents new requests
        - Calling shutdown() puts a "poison pill" response to unblock any waiting threads
        - This ensures graceful addon shutdown without deadlocks

    Attributes:
        request_queue: Requests from background thread to main thread.
        response_queue: Responses from main thread back to background thread.

    Example:
        >>> bridge = QueueBridge()
        >>>
        >>> # In background thread (MCP server):
        >>> request = ToolRequest(
        ...     request_id="abc-123",
        ...     tool_name="list_decks",
        ...     arguments={}
        ... )
        >>> response = bridge.send_request(request)  # Blocks until main thread responds
        >>>
        >>> # In main thread (QTimer callback):
        >>> request = bridge.get_pending_request()  # Non-blocking
        >>> if request:
        ...     result = execute_on_anki(request)
        ...     response = ToolResponse(
        ...         request_id=request.request_id,
        ...         success=True,
        ...         result=result
